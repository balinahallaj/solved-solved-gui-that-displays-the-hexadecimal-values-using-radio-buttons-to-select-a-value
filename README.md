Final Project (25%)- This project focuses on demonstrating your understanding of Java Collections. Before attempting this project, be sure you have completed all of the reading assignments listed in the syllabus to date, participated in the weekly conferences, and thoroughly understand the examples throughout the chapters. The project requirements include: 1. Write a Java application that effectively uses Java collections to store pairs of unique colors and their unique hexadecimal values. (For example, Red – FF0000). Store up to 20 of these pairs. Then write a GUI that displays the hexadecimal values using radio buttons to select a value. When selected the background of the GUI should change to that color. 2. Your program should compile and run without errors. This is a GUI application that, upon loading, reads a list of color names and hex values from a text file, colours.txt. Each color is represented in the application by a button that, when pressed, changes the color of the app’s background.
